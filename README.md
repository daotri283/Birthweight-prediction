# Birthweight-prediction
Certain factors contribute to the health of a newborn baby. One such health measure is birth weight. Countless studies have identified factors, both preventative and hereditary, that lead to low birth weight. I have acted as public health consultants to analyze and model an infantâ€™s birth weight based on such characteristics. I have also included my insight in the pdf files. 
The steps that I have taken to analyze the problem: 
  1: Clean up the data
  2: Data visualization 
  3: Machine learining alogrithm 
  4: Picking the best performing alogrithm
